Title: School of Humans
---
School of Humans is an organisation dedicated to the imaginative and qualitative exploration of humans and human experiences. 

It is a pedagogical experiment in holding space, as we all work towards improving communication, and inter- and intra- personal development, so together we can experience the joy of seeing other humans (and ourselves!) evolve before we die. When the quality of our lives is so hugely dependant on the relationships we form, why are we never taught, from the time we are children, these fundamental things?

We feel it’s imperative that humans look more deeply inside themselves to understand who they are and why they are and to share those experiences with others. Not only as a means to be seen, to connect and relate with others, and to stop the cycle of intergenerational trauma that, at times, appears to be in perpetual motion. But by understanding our own value, we can more fully understand the value in others.

Communication is hard! But we believe that if we can set up safe spaces that allow us to practise giving words to those difficult truths, then there is hope!

School of Humans is a sister school of School of Machines, Making and Make Believe, an independent school based in Berlin, Germany. School of Machines has been and continues to be an exploration in technology and its impacts on humans and society. But we’ve found increasingly often that there are important topics to be covered that may have nothing at all to do with technology and much more to do with the ever-complex experiences of being human. At this point, we know what’s most important—humans are.

But if we want to make the world a better place, we all have to become better people. If for no other reason than this— Because It Is Time To Be Whole Again.

Change relies on us coming together, therefore, learning to build stronger relationships must become a priority if we are going to empower community led systemic change, and this is our goal! To lead workshops, events and conversations that, through our engagement with each other, teach us how to better handle all the trickier, emotional, and even painful parts of being human, and to document these truths through art and data.

This is our permission to let go of everything holding us back and to explore all the other possibilities. We all know death is inevitable, but while we are still here, let’s find a better, more joyful way to be ALIVE. Come join us!
